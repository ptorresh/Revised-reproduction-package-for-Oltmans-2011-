/*The 8 following regressions are OLS estimates of the effect of 1980 segregation (dism1980) on human capital of 22 to 30 year olds in 1980. These regressions will produce biased results since they don't take into account that segregation is endogenous. Therefore, estimates from these regressions will underestimate the effect of segregation on human capital. The standard errors are clustered at the city label (name) to correct for arbitrary nonindependence of observations within a city. Estimates also control for age levels (agedum* are dummies for group ages from 22 to 30). Note: the specifications for this table should exclude one age dummy due to perfect multicollinearity. */
